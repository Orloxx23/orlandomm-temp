# How I built **PlaySwap** with *v0* and vibe coding

A while ago, I was a loyal **Spotify** user. My playlists were carefully crafted, full of bangers for every imaginable mood. But eventually, for convenience (and because I was already paying for YouTube Premium), I switched to **YouTube Music**.

All good... except for one *tiny* problem:  
**Where are my playlists?**

I thought: "There must be a tool to migrate playlists from Spotify to YouTube Music, right?"  
But instead of searching for something that already exists, I remembered something way more fun:  
**vibe coding** + **[v0.dev](https://v0.dev)**.

So I said: *"Why not just build it myself?"* ðŸ§ª

## First steps: from chaos to MVP

The idea was simple â€” move playlists between platforms.  
Using v0 was magical. After just a couple of iterations, I had a working MVP.  
A few more tweaks and the UI looked *chefâ€™s kiss* â€” clean, modern, and professional.

> I felt like a pharaoh giving commands to a digital servant:  
> *"Build me a UI worthy of the gods!"*  
> And v0, without complaint, obeyed.

Pure **vibe coding** at its finest.

## Plot twist: damn YouTube API ðŸ˜¤

The original plan was to migrate playlists **from Spotify to YouTube Music**.  
But **YouTube's API has an absurdly low daily quota**, so I couldnâ€™t perform large-scale searches.

So I had to pivot.

Now, **we only support migrating from YouTube to Spotify**.  
A downgrade in functionality, but an upgrade in reliability.

## Saved by AI (thanks Gemini)

One of the biggest challenges was matching songs between platforms.  
YouTube doesnâ€™t return track titles exactly as expected, which made finding the same song on Spotify a mess.

So I integrated **Gemini**, Googleâ€™s AI, to help normalize song titles.  
With AI in the loop, match accuracy improved a ton â€” even when titles were weird or full of typos.

## Conclusion

**PlaySwap** was born from a personal need, shaped by modern tools, and enhanced with artificial intelligence.  
Itâ€™s not perfect, but itâ€™s *useful*, *fast to build*, and above all, *fun to make*.

If youâ€™re thinking about trying this **vibe coding** approach â€” let me warn you:  
itâ€™s addictive. ðŸ˜Ž
